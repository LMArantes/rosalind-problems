# Rosalind Bioinformatics Problem Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from the [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) platform â€” a project for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.

## About

The problems here are solved using Python and reflect my approach to each challenge.

This project is both a **learning exercise** and a way to **track my progress** through the Rosalind problem set.

> **Disclaimer:** All problems are owned and authored by the Rosalind team. I do not claim ownership over the problem statements or the original content on their site.
